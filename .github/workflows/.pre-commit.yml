# Sometimes this workflow fails due to problems in the target PR branch. I (Agustín Díaz) don't know yet the reason why the code is analyzing for the merge commit instead of the PR branch.
# Anyways, it's an indicator that the target PR branch is not clean. This is a good thing because it helps to keep the codebase clean.
# To fix this, rebase the PR branch with the target branch and check `pre-commit run --all-files` locally.
